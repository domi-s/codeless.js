note This webpage is made in Codeless.
 
Codeless is a simple, fast and easy-to-use website builder, with easy configuration and setup.
It is also free and doesn't require programming knowledge.

sub Getting started
Before building your website, download codeless.js.
The next step is to create an HTML file. To do so, follow <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~twtaylor/teaching/29/web/notepad.html" target="_blank">this simple tutorial</a>.
After that, add the following to the file:
code &lt;script src="codeless.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
Perfect! You're ready to start your page!

sub The first lines
To add text, just start typing before the [script] part:
code This is my website!
Output:
This is my website!

If you want to add a header title, on a new line type "header" followed by the header text:
code header Amazing website!
Output:
header Amazing website!

By changing "header" with "sub", you create a subtitle:
code sub Amazing title
Output:
sub Amazing title

sub Other commands
Similar to the commands mentioned previously, you can type in "note" followed by the note text:
code note This is just a note.
Output:
note This is just a note.
 
Or you can type in "alert" followed by the alert text:
code alert This is just an alert.
Output:
alert This is just an alert.
 
Adding code is as easy as typing "code" followed by the code text:
code code This.is(some[code]);
Output:
code This.is(some[code]);

sub Images
Images are created by typing "image" followed by the URL of the image. Images are always 500px wide.
code image https://via.placeholder.com/500x140
Output:
image https://via.placeholder.com/500x140
 
Larger or smaller images are always resized to 500px:
